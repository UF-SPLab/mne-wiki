The code visualizes some of the elements of convolution and deconvolution\nformat: revealjs\neditor: visual\n---\n\n## Convolution and deconvolution: an Illustration\n\nThis live script visualizes some of the elements of convolution and deconvolution\n\n1\\) Convolution: a simple mathematical function that quantifies the similarity between a pattern (a \"kernel\") such as the red square wave below with data (the blue rectangularish thingy below). The convolution (black line) reflects how similar the blue signal is with the kernel at any given time point. Convolution is thus used in all of digital signal processing.\n\n\\##\n\nThe math is simple. We take the kernel, move it to the first portion of the data by lining it up with the first sample point, then we multiply each element of the kernel with the data, sum the results into one new number and write that to that first sample point.\n\n\n\n## Convolution in signal generation and in fMRI research.\n\nif we want to generate a signal where a certain pattern (the kernel) occurs at certain times, we can use convolution to achieve that. Thus, programs liek SPM use convolution of stimulus timinng info with a lernel that resembles the typical BOLD (fMRI) response as the kernel to generate fake, ideal, fMRI activation for comparison/correlation with the real data:\n\n\n```{matlab eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}\n#First, make onsets for 120 MR images. \nonsets = zeros(1, 120); \nonsets(2:11:end) = 1; #simple case where a stimulus is on every 11 scans\nplot(onsets), title ('simulated stimulus onsets, every 11 scans')\n```\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](de_convolution_files/figure-revealjs/cell-3-output-1.png){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\\##\n\n\n```{matlab eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}\n# now we make a kernel\n# the inverted gamma function is nice because it looks like fMRI in V1\n# let's make one that is 10 scans long\nkernel = (1./math.gamma(0.1:0.5:5))\nfigure\nplt.plot(1./gamma(0.1:0.5:5)), title('an inverted gamma kernel, length 10')\n\n```\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](de_convolution_files/figure-revealjs/cell-4-output-1.png){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\\##\n\nNow we just convolve the onsets with the kernel and plot the result\n\n\n```{matlab eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}\nconvolution  = conv(onsets, kernel); \nfigure\nplot(convolution), title('onset vector convolved with canonical BOLD response')\n```\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=4}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](de_convolution_files/figure-revealjs/cell-5-output-1.png){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## \n\nSo this basically puts each 10 second kernel at the location where the onset is.

Because of the shifting and summing up portion of the algorithm, if the Kernel spans multiple, similar events, it will show temporal summation.\n\n## \n\nThis is more interesting with variable inter-onset times.\n\n\n```{matlab eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}\n\nonsets = zeros(1, 120);\nonsets([3 14 22 36 46 50 66 86 91 106 115]) = 1; #simple case where a stimulus is on every 11 scans\nplot(onsets), title ('simulated stimulus onsets, every 11 scans')\n\n```\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=7}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n(120, 1)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](de_convolution_files/figure-revealjs/cell-8-output-2.png){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\\##\n\nNow we convolve these onset times with the same kernel\n\n\n```{matlab eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}\n\nconvolution  = conv(onsets, kernel); \nfigure\nplot(convolution), title('Convolution of random ITIs')\n\n```\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=8}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](de_convolution_files/figure-revealjs/cell-9-output-1.png){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLonger intervals between onsets prompt complete reduction to baseline, temporal proximity prompts smeared, overlapping events.
