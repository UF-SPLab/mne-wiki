We discussed how capabilities of scientific python ecosystem are leveraged and organized in MNE in order to compose reproducible analysis pipelines that are easy to understand and efficient to use. The extensive documentation of the MNE website provides instructions for installation and configuration. Extensive examples and tutorials on the MNE documentation website allows users to benefit directly by searching, downloading, testing and incrementally adapting code.\nIntroduction to Scripting with MNE-Python"

Open source analysis tools are usually a work in progress. Documentation for these tools, if present at all, will be incomplete or out of date. The purpose of this slideshow is to explore concepts that will enable team coordination on software usage and code development projects. The hope is that users will be able to find the information that they need from development notes and communication between code authors. In the long-term, notes and comments about the intended function, rationale, and usage of code will be useful for outsiders but also for the project organizers and code developers themselves."
