1. [Log on to HiPerGator (HPG)](#log-on-to-hipergator-hpg)
2. [Use HPG OpenOnDemand to start the *Interactive App*: *HiPerGator Desktop*](#use-hpg-openondemand-to-start-the-interactive-app-hipergator-desktop)   
3. [Open *Terminal* to enter 3 lines of command-line code to start DLC GUI](#open-terminal-to-enter-3-lines-of-command-line-code-to-start-dlc-gui)  
4. [Point DLC to a *config.yaml* file in existing project](#point-dlc-to-a-config.yaml-file-in-existing-project)  
5. [Point DLC to a *labeled videos* directory and *load* the images](#point-dlc-to-a-labeled-videos-directory-and-load-the-images)   


## Log on to HiPerGator (HPG) OpenOnDemand

Use a Chrome Browser for best results.  
*Importantly,* [go to (linked UFRC page) for details & video on HiPerGator-OpenOnDemand](https://help.rc.ufl.edu/doc/Open_OnDemand)

**Type this address in the navigation bar**:
- `https://ondemand.rc.ufl.edu`



You will need to type then select `University of Florida` for your home organization.

## Use HPG OpenOnDemand to start the *Interactive App*: *HiPerGator Desktop* 

When options for the desktop are available (see 2nd next figure below):  

- **10** or more Gb of Max Memory (third text box)  
- 1 to 4 hours for Time Requested (4th text box)  
- select *Default* Cluster Partition (5th box dropdown)  
   - **BUT,** If you're training the model with GPU settings select the *GPU* cluster partition. [*ONLY for neural-network training; Use the Default cluster partition for image labeling and adjusting labels. We have limited GPU resources.*]   
      - However, with *GPU* selected you will also need to type `gpu:a100:1` in the Generic Resource Request field (2nd text box from bottom of page.)  

After you have typed the settings click blue **Launch** button(s) as they appear (see the bottom of 2rd & 3rd figures, below)

## Point DLC to a *config.yaml* file in existing project 

- Click on tab, **Manage Project**, when the DeepLabCut GUI appears.
- Then, click **Load existing project** & **Browse** in order to find *config.yaml* settings file. 
- The folder location is something like:
   - */blue/psy4911/<yourname>/try-dlc/DeepLabCut/examples/openfield-Pranav-2018-10-30/config.yaml*  
- Once you select *config.yaml*  click the open button and the click ok again.
