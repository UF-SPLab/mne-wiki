## Navigate to HiPerGator through OpenOnDemand
- To start off, type in your browser: `https://ood.rc.ufl.edu`
- If this is the first time going to OpenOnDemand in your browser there will be a page re-direct to InCommon.org
- ![](incommon.png)
- From this re-direct website type Florida in the institution and select "University of Florida" from the dropdown menu.
- From here you would login with 2-factor authentication as you typically would for Canvas.
- ![](hpg2-factor.png)
- After OpenOnDemand successfully loads select the **Files** dropdown
- ![](ood_hpg_main.png)
- Select **/blue/psy4911** 
- ![](ood_bluefolder.png)
- Next, when you are in the correct location you can open a terminal to create a shortcut so that you can always find your blue-folder
- ![](open_terminal.png)  

- Type a symlink command in the terminal: `ln -s /blue/psy4911 blue_psy4911`

- ![](blue_shortct.png)
- Confirm that the shortcut was made by typing: `find . -maxdepth l type l -ls`

## Create a folder for downloading files and examples to your blue drive for learning DeepLabCut  
- There are two ways to navigate the blue drive filesystem: OpenOnDemand GUI & Terminal (command line)
   - if you're not sure how to navigate to a directory from the command line go to these links:
      - [Intro to command line](https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0020.php)
      - [Command line tips](http://www.hpc-carpentry.org/hpc-shell/02-navigation/index.html)
      - [Understanding file paths from the command line](https://datacarpentry.org/shell-genomics/02-the-filesystem/index.html)
- Create a new folder so that you can do DeepLabCut tutorials and examples
- ![](make-new-folder.png)  
- Navigate to your blue drive personal folder "/blue/psy4911/*yourname*/" then make a folder named *try-dlc*
- ![](make_try_dlc.png)  
- The easiest way to start out in terminal from OOD is to click on the folder that you made 
- ![](nav2try-dlc.png)
- ...then from that location click **Open in Terminal**
- ![](try_dlc_term.png)  
  
## Clone all example material from GitHub to a folder on your Blue Drive  
- From the chosen folder on your **/blue/psy4911/***yourname***/** folder install DeepLabCut using the following commands in terminal: 
   - `module load conda`
   - `git clone https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut.git`  
   - Navigate to the new folder /blue/psy4911/***yourname***/*DeepLabCut/* by typing `cd DeepLabCut/deeplabcut`
   - to run from the command line type `module load deeplabcut/2.2.1`
   - then type `ipython`
   - if you type `?deeplabcut` on the command line you can see that everything in DeepLabCut 2.0 is available from the command line
   - type `exit()` to leave ipython

- To Run Napari from the remote GUI on HPG start HiperGator Desktop then open a terminal on the desktop and type:  
- `module spider Napari`
- `module load napari/0.4.7`
