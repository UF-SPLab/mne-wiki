- To start off, type in your browser: `https://ood.rc.ufl.edu`
- From this website type Florida in the institution and select "University of Florida" from the dropdown menu.
- From here you would login with 2-factor authentication as you typically would for Canvas.
- After OpenOnDemand successfully loads select the **Files** dropdown
- ![](ood_hpg_main.png)
- Select **/blue/psy4911** 
- ![](ood_bluefolder.png)
- Next, when you are in the correct location you can open a terminal to create a shortcut so that you can always find your blue-folder
- ![](open_terminal.png)  

- Type a symlink command in the terminal: `ln -s /blue/psy4911 blue_psy4911`

- ![](blue_shortct.png)
- Confirm that the shortcut was made: `find . -maxdepth l type l -ls`  
- ![](blue_shortcut.png)  
- Create a folder for downloading files and examples to your blue drive for learning DeepLabCut  
- I made a folder named *try-dlc* (if you're not sure how to navigate to a directory from the command line here's a reference to check out: )   
- ![](make-new-folder.png)  
- ![](make_try_dlc.png)  
- The easiest way to start out in terminal from OOD is to click on the folder that you made 
- ![](nav2try-dlc.png)
- ...then from that location click **Open in Terminal**
- ![](try_dlc_term.png)
- From the chosen folder on your **blue_4911** folder install DeepLabCut using the following commands in terminal: 
   - `module load conda`
   - `git clone https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut.git`  
   -

- To Run Napari from the remote GUI on HPG:  
- `module spider Napari`

- `Napari`
